        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Resident Alien (S1-2).</i> I'm not into cringe comedy so Alan Tudyk needs to dial it back like 30% but otherwise this is a shockingly good show. I came for literally anything to do with Alice Wetterlund and I stayed for beautiful moments about friends building a community life together and Corey Reynolds' incredible nonsense monologues. I will steal season 3 sometime soon.</li>
          <li>
            <i>Star Trek: Discovery (S5).</i> It was alright. Didn't blow me out of the water like you ought to if you're pulling out the Progenitors, but the alien first contact at the end of season 4 was so cool and weird that I would feel greedy if I complained about this now. I liked that they ended with <spoiler>Michael being a cool old lady in a nice house with a family. That's my kind of fanservice.</spoiler>

        <h4>Books</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Blindsight (Peter Watts).</i> A lot of the horror of this story missed me because I've been jaded for a long time already about the idea that I'm a whole conscious entity. It was a trip reading it now for the first time because non-conscious algorithms that produce convincing human language without understanding are a real danger that I have to dodge at my actual day job in 2024. My unanswered discussion question is: Why are people are attached to conscious awareness as an essential human trait, and why are they unsettled by the thought of not having it?</li>
          <li>
            <i>The Other Significant Others (Rhaina Cohen).</i> A very timely read as I'm currently having a mild early midlife crisis about whether or not I'll have meaningful long-term relationships without getting married and having kids. This book didn't give me advice or, you know, hope, but I guess I would heartily recommend it as an informative overview of the subject.</li>
