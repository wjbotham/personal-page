        <h4>Books</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>System Collapse (Martha Wells).</i> Murderbot Diaries is my current favorite of all the many stories about a robot learning what it means to be human. In this one Murderbot <spoiler>struggles with PTSD from the last book's events</spoiler> and <spoiler>makes some uncharacteristically mature decisions</spoiler> and I love that.</li>
          <li>
            <i>To the King a Daughter (Andre Norton and Sasha Miller).</i> "I love Andre Norton's sci-fi," I said. "I bet I'll enjoy her fantasy too," I said. It's not in my nature to hate a book unless it's, like, actually racist or something, but dang this book felt bad to read. It was like a genericized mashup of Dune and Game of Thrones and there was a lot of clunky grammar and confusing sentences even by the standards of fantasy novels trying to sound old-timey. Worst of all, there's an evil bog; I will not tolerate wetland slander. (It's entirely possible that her sci-fi is also bad and I just have lower standards for it because I love pulp SF trash. Alas, this one didn't have evil time travel clones or psychic cats to save it.)</li>

        <h4>Television</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Mrs. Davis.</i> I already watched it last year, but this has been the month of pirating it (give me a DVD release!!), rewatching it over and over, making a spreadsheet about it, studying crew interviews, and trying to convince all my friends to see it. I might make a Mrs. Davis fan page one of these days.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Games</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Starship Simulator Demo.</i> This got me super excited about playing a highly detailed spaceship simulation with lots of room for mastery and complex problems to fix cooperatively with your friends, but all their talk about procedurally generated content has convinced me that this has already failed. If you need AI-generated voice lines because you don't want to do the work to record actual people, you probably don't have it in you to finish a project this ambitious.</li>
          <li>
            <i>Geneforge: Mutagen.</i> The original Geneforge was a formative experience for me, though I never got anywhere close to finishing it as a kid. Now I'm trying it again for the second time as an adult. Wish me luck and remind me to actually use my healing pods.</li>
