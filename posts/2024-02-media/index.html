      <h2>February 2024 Media</h2>
      <p>Books</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>How Long 'til Black Future Month? (N.K. Jemisin).</i> Predictably, I loved the time travel stories and the stories about digital beings. <i>The Ones Who Stay and Fight</i> was the first time I've ever actually been interested in a reaction to <i>The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas</i>.</li>
        <li>
          <i>The Golden Enclaves (Naomi Novik).</i> I enjoyed the first two books mainly as an investigation of collective action problems and to my surprise the third book doubled down on that subject in a very cool way I did not see coming.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Television</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Bodies.</i> I didn't even know this show was going to be about <spoiler>a causal time loop</spoiler>, but that's always a pleasant surprise.</li>
        <li>
          <i>Twin Peaks: The Return.</i> Twin Peaks is many things. It is a soap opera that delights in quirky, unhinged people. It is a drama touching on heavy topics like domestic abuse, mental illness, and drug abuse. It is an occult allegory that makes just barely enough sense for people to have interesting conversations about it. It is hours on hours of trolling the audience. Season 3 delivered on each of these, especially the last one.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Games</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Solium Infernum</i> absolutely delights me. I'm waking up every morning so excited to see what vile tricks my opponents have gotten up to in our asynchronous game.</li>
      </ul>
