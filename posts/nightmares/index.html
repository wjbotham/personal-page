      <h2>Nightmares</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>When I was a teenager I dreamed that there were these freaky zombie elk and deer outside our house. One of them broke in through the bathroom and fell over dead then bloated and exploded and anyone who got its orange gunk on them would become an exploding zombie. I tried to escape but they surrounded me and I had to stand on top of a car and scream for help.</li>
        <li>When I was a teenager I had sleep paralysis and a shadowy figure wearing my mother's face ran into the room, got a few inches from my face, and started screaming at me.</li>
        <li>I don't remember anything else about this dream but one time I dreamed about a huge malevolent ball of long black needles, all joined together in a point at the middle with no central body. When not hunting prey it would curve all its needles down and balance on a single point. I turned it into a Mage: The Ascension villain.</li>
        <li>I dreamed there was a nuclear war and I fled to a shack on a mountain and listened to the radio for other survivors for months. I remember hoping it was just a bad dream but realizing it had been too long to fit into a single night.</li>
        <li>I dreamed I got a nasty injury on my arm and after I woke up I spent the morning with an urge to clean and care for the nonexistent wound.</li>
        <li>I dreamed that I had a second cat who disappeared a long time ago and I was despondent to realize I had forgotten their name and what they looked like and I was like desperately searching my social media for pictures of my nonexistent other cat to figure it out.</li>
        <li>I've had two dreams where I had committed a murder (the dream never included the murder, just the aftermath) and I was regretful about killing someone and also massively stressed out trying to make sure there wasn't any trace evidence linking me to the time and place of the crime.</li>
        <li>I had a dream about a hurricane big enough to carry radioactive material from a nuclear plant in Florida all the way here to Nebraska.</li>
        <li>In 2010 I dreamed it was 2011 and I was working at my old summer camp. Somehow I realized that I was missing a whole year of memories between summer 2010 and summer 2011 and panicked and demanded that they tell me what I did in the missing year. I woke up feeling disoriented.</li>
        <li>One time I dreamed I was dying and I had to race to write letters for everyone I love so they'd have closure. At one point in the dream I dreamed that I woke up, realized it was all a dream, and immediately learned that I was still dying in the new outer layer of the dream and still had to write letters.</li>
      </ul>
