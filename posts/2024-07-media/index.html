        <h4>Movies</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Nope.</i> I don't care for horror unless it has big ideas about the human need to be at the center of the universe. God I hope they never make a sequel.</li>
          <li>
            <i>Tenet.</i> A bad spy movie with weird pacing but a very cool time travel movie?</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Television</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Counterpart.</i> A very cool spy show about a cold war between our world and a parallel universe that was identical until 30 years ago. The main character is a meek bureaucrat and his alternate is a hardened spy; I expected it to go in a direction where they each succumb to temptations to become more like each other but they both end up being stuck in their ways, more of a meditation on grieving what could have been.</li>
          <li>
            <i>The Owl House (S1).</i> Super charming. Cool wizard duels. Relatable tired old Xennial lady.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="list">
        <h4>Books</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>The Ballad of Black Tom (Victor LaVelle).</i> More brutal than I can usually stomach but a great story that does more with cosmic horror than terrified baby H.P. Lovecraft ever did.</li>
          <li>
            <i>Victories Greater Than Death (Charlie Jane Anders).</i> More YA than I was expecting but a decent queer space opera story. It has the best explanation I've heard for the prevalence of humanoid aliens: <spoiler>Because the first spacefaring civilization were humanoid chauvinists and destroyed all the non-humanoid species they could find.</spoiler>
