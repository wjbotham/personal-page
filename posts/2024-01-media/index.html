        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>She-Ra (seasons 4 and 5).</i> I took several years off from watching She-Ra due to a breakup so I had to jump around a range of about ten episodes to figure out what was going on when I stopped. I like Scorpia. There are probably going to be more magical princesses in RPGs I run in the future.</li>
          <li>
            <i>Carol and the End of the World.</i> A very nice story about people seeking meaningful connections in the apocalypse, so basically me irl. My favorite episode is an anthology of stories about items in the office lost and found.</li>
          <li>
            <i>Russian Doll.</i> I'll watch anything with time travel in it but this is the best kind of time travel story, one that doesn't explain the time travel and uses it unashamedly to explore deep topics (in this case death, aging, and generational trauma).</li>
